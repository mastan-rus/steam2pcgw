# Steam 2 PCGW

The goal of this tool is to simplify the process of creating new articles for the PC Gaming Wiki by just simply entering the Steam App ID.

## Why Should I Use This?

Well, it's certainly up to you to decide whether you want to use it or not, and no one will force you to use it, but there are good reasons why you should, even if for certain templates:

- Games with massive DLCs, such as The Sims/Euro Truck Simulator 2/American Truck Simulator/Cities Skylines to name a few.
- Parses most system requirements FLAWLESSLY!
- Fills in most of the information available from the API which you may copy-paste and modify as you go!
- Makes it harder to not skip something while filling in the information.

## Version

v0.0.76

## How To

1. Either visit the Releases page and download the latest build from there.
2. Download the ZIP (Press 'Code' â†’ 'Download ZIP') or Clone.
3. Create two directories where the executable is placed: `cache` (stores all the Steam Page and Steam API cache) and `output` (outputs all the generated articles in there).
4. Run the executable or type `go run .` (you'll require Go <https://go.dev/doc/install> to do this!).
